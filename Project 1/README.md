# Project 1 - Fun with Words

### Description
This project familiarized me with operations on arrays, including simple sorting and searching algorithms, through use of mutliple dictionary "databases". Words are loaded in from `.txt` files and basic sort and search algorithms are applied (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, linear search, binary search).

### Given Files
* Dictionaries
	* [tiny.txt](src/tiny.txt)
	* [short.txt](src/short.txt)
	* [english.txt](src/english.txt)
	* [french.txt](french.txt)
* [DictionaryApp1.java](src/DictionaryApp1.java)
* [DictionaryApp2.java](src/DictionaryApp2.java)
* [DictionaryApp3.java](src/DictionaryApp3.java)
* [DictionaryApp4.java](src/DictionaryApp4.java)
* [DictionaryApp5.java](src/DictionaryApp5.java)
* [EasyIn.java](src/EasyIn.java)

### Modified Files
* [Dictionary.java](src/Dictionary.java)
* [Collection.java](src/Collection.java)

### Application Descriptions
#### [Dictionary App 1](src/DictionaryApp1.java)
Loads a dictionary that is unsorted by default, applies a sorting algorithm (bubble, selection, or insertion), and saves the sorted words to a file ending in "-sorted".

#### [Dictionary App 2](src/DictionaryApp2.java)
Loads a dictionary and applies binary (if sorted) or linear search on a given number of randomly selected words.

#### [Dictionary App 3](src/DictionaryApp3.java)
Loads two dictionaries, and combines them into a sorted or unsorted file.

#### [Dictionary App 4](src/DictionaryApp4.java)
Creates a collection of dictionaries of same sized words from a given input file, and saves each dictionary in its own file.

#### [Dictionary App 5](src/DictionaryApp5.java)
Loads a collection of same sized words, and attempts to match up words to the given input parameters.
