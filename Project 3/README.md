# Project 3 - Fun with Matrices

### Description
This project familiarized me with matrices and linked lists by having me store matrices both densely with a 2D array, and sparsely with a linked list, and having me perform numerous operations on them.

### Application Descriptions
#### [App 1](src/App1.java)
Utilizes an array to represent a vector and perform some basic operations on the array.

#### [App 2](src/App2.java)
Similar to App 1, but utilizing a linked-list to back the vectors.

#### [App 3](src/App3.java)
Implements a densely stored matrix using a 2D array and performs some basic multiplication between a matrix and vector.

#### [App 4](src/App4.java)
Similar to App 3, but utilizing a linked-list to sparsely store the matrix (ignores values of zero for storage).

#### [App 5](src/App5.java)
Converts between dense and sparse storage for an array, and determines the elements in the diagonal of the matrix.

#### [App 6](src/App6.java)
Randomly generates elements to fill a square matrix of the size specified by the user, and stores the matrix both densely and sparsely, comparing efficiency of the two methods.

#### [App 7](src/App7.java)
Similar to App 6, but only generates a sparse matrix, allowing you to create matrices of greater size.

#### [App 8](src/App8.java)
Utilizes a basic algorithm to attempt to solve for the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvactor of a matrix
