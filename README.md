# Data-Structures-Projects

A copy of the six projects I did in Java for my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Each of the projects is run through a collection of `App` classes, which utilize the other classes.

## Project 1 - Fun With Words
This project familiarized me with operations on arrays, including simple sorting and searching algorithms, through use of mutliple dictionary "databases". Words are loaded in from `.txt` files and basic sort and search algorithms are applied (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, linear search, binary search).

## Project 2 - Fun With Numbers
This project familiarized me with stacks and queues by having me create a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator for complex numbers that performed various mathematical operations.

## Project 3 - Fun With Matrix
This project familiarized me with matrices and linked lists by having me store matrices both densely with a 2D array, and sparsely with a linked list, and having me perform numerous operations on them.

## Project 4 - Fun With Trees
This project familiarized me with operations on binary search trees. Utilizes a similar approach to Project 1 of loading several words from text files and sorting/searching them.

## Project 5 - Fun With Movies
This project familiarized me with hash tables and advanced sorting techniques, utilizing a database of movie information to be loaded from a file and sorted/searched.

## Project 6 - Fun With Graphs
This project familiarized me with graphs utilizing a rectangular grid of vertices. I implemented various graph algorithms to search and operate on these grids, including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Prim's algorithm.
